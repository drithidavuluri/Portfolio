            In the era of expanding customer-centric services, accurate
            prediction of customer satisfaction is critical for businesses. This
            study explores the application of advanced machine learning and
            neural network models for predicting customer satisfaction in the
            airline industry using the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset.
            We compare traditional models such as Random Forest and XGBoost with
            more complex architectures, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and
            innovative models like Quantum-Inspired Neural Networks (QINN)
            (which incorporate entanglement and superposition principles), both
            with and without attention mechanisms. Our results show that
            integrating attention layers into the models enhances their
            performance. Additionally, a stacked ensemble model combining
            XGBoost, Random Forest, DNN with attention, and QINN with attention
            achieved commendable results. To ensure interpretability and
            transparency, we employed a range of Explainable AI (XAI)
            techniques, including but not limited to LIME, Permutation
            Importance, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Integrated
            Gradients. These methods enabled us to examine the modelsâ€™
            decision-making processes and assess the influence of attention on
            feature importance. Overall, our work revealed that the attention
            mechanism not only improved accuracy but also highlighted key
            features more effectively, providing deeper insights into the
            factors driving customer satisfaction. The combination of
            high-performing models and explainability tools offers a robust
            solution for both accurate predictions and transparent
            decision-making in customer satisfaction analysis.
